# Weekly Report 1

**Hours worked:** 5

## What did I do this week?
This week I familiarized myself with the course project guidelines and reviewed the requirements. I decided on the project topic, which is implementing an AI player for the game Connect4. I sort of planned the overall structure of the project repository and outlined the main components of the system, including the game logic, the AI part, and documentation structure. I also reviewd some material from old courses as a reminder for search algorithms.

## How has the program progressed?
No full implementation has been completed yet, but the project structure is almost 100%. The focus has been the artificial intelligence rather than game implementation. The repo structure has been planned to separate game logic, AI algorithms, testing, and documentation.

## What did I learn this week?
I gained a clearer understanding of the expectations and grading criteria of the course project. I also refreshed my knowledge of search problems and how games like Connect4 can be modeled as game trees for AI decision making. Additionally I familiarised my self with the weekly reporting gudlines this report is for week1 since i had some problems with github im uploading this now.

## What remains unclear or has been challenging?
At this stage, I believe the most challenging part will be designing an the evaluation function that performs well under limited search depth.

## What will I do next?
Next week, I will implement the core game logic for Connect Four, including the board representation, move generation, and win detection. I will also begin implementing a basic AI player, starting with a random strategy, before moving on to the minimax algorithm with alpha beta pruning.
